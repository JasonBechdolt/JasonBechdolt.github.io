   <h1 id="title"> Jason Bechdolt was here.</h1>
   <p> I live in and was born in San Jose California, I'm a freshman at San Jose State University,
      and I'm majoring in Digital Media Arts. I ran Cross Country and Track and Frield in high school,
      and I tend to play Roguelike, RPG, Metroidvania and Survival Games. My largest Passion project was
      a card game that I built up throughout middle school and high school that I would play with my friends.
      It wasn't marketable due to using characters from franchises I didn't own, and art my artists I didn't pay,
      but it was greatly enjoyable and gave me an outlet for my creative energy. </p>
